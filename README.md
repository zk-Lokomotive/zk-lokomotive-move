* Since we can fully integrate this into the crosschain in the future, this demo only represents file transfer with zk on the Solana network and support is received from [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) ([signaling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling)) for **P2P** communication.


## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Project Overview**
Our project aims to enable secure, private, and efficient file transfers across different blockchain networks. Utilizing zkSNARKs for encryption, Arweave for decentralized storage, and the Wormhole bridge for cross-chain token transfer, we ensure that files can be shared securely from Aptos to EVM networks.

### **1.2 Problem Statement**
Traditional file transfer methods often suffer from privacy and security vulnerabilities. Centralized servers are prone to data breaches, and current blockchain solutions lack seamless interoperability.

## **1.3 Motivation:**

Providing the amount of our data continues rapidly in the technological singularity. Traditional file formats often lack adequate privacy and security, especially when it comes to sensitive data. File services run on a central server, creating the risk of data breaches and privacy violations. We offer a different solution to this than traditional breaks, by combining the powerful capacities and polynomials of mathematics and the decentralized generality of Solana, thus challenging the trilemma.

### Encrypting the File:
First, encrypt the file using zkSNARKs to ensure privacy and security. zkSNARKs allow you to prove the fileâ€™s integrity without revealing its contents.
Upload the encrypted file to a decentralized storage solution like Arweave, obtaining a unique file hash.

### Tokenizing the File Hash:
Create a token representing the file hash. This involves wrapping the hash into a token that can be transferred across different blockchain networks.
Use smart contracts to mint this token on the Aptos network.

### Using the Wormhole Bridge:
Wormhole is a cross-chain bridge that facilitates the transfer of tokenized assets between different blockchains, including Aptos and EVM.
The process involves locking the tokenized file hash on the Aptos network and minting an equivalent token on the EVM network.
Guardians (validators) on the Wormhole network monitor the lock and mint actions to ensure they are synchronized across chains.

### Transmitting the Tokenized File Hash:
Initiate the transfer of the tokenized file hash from the Aptos network to the EVM network using the Wormhole bridge.
The Wormhole protocol ensures the secure and verified transmission of the tokenized asset between networks.

### Verification and Access on EVM:
On the EVM side, the recipient can use the token to retrieve the file hash.
Verify the file hash against the encrypted file stored on Arweave to ensure integrity and authenticity.



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, install the following:

- [Aptos prerequisites](https://docs.Aptos.io/build/install#prerequisites) (Aptos prerequisites only)
- [Aptosbase](https://Aptosbase.io/how-to/install.html)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Node (>= 20)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm (>= 9)](https://pnpm.io/installation)


```bash
pnpm create Aptos-dapp@latest
```

## Usage
[package]
name = "greeting"
edition = "2024.beta" # edition = "legacy" to use legacy (pre-2024) Move

[dependencies]
Aptos = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/Aptos.git", subdir = "crates/Aptos-framework/packages/Aptos-framework", rev = "framework/devnet" }

 For remote import, use the `{ git = "...", subdir = "...", rev = "..." }`.
 Revision can be a branch, a tag, and a commit hash.
 MyRemotePackage = { git = "https://some.remote/host.git", subdir = "remote/path", rev = "main" }

 For local dependencies use `local = path`. Path is relative to the package root
 Local = { local = "../path/to" }

 To resolve a version conflict and force a specific version for dependency
 override use `override = true`
 Override = { local = "../conflicting/version", override = true }

[addresses]
greeting = "0x0"

 Named addresses will be accessible in Move as `@name`. They're also exported:
 for example, `std = "0x1"` is exported by the Standard Library.
 alice = "0xA11CE"

[dev-dependencies]
 The dev-dependencies section allows overriding dependencies for `--test` and
 `--dev` modes. You can introduce test-only dependencies here.
 Local = { local = "../path/to/dev-build" }

[dev-addresses]
 The dev-addresses section allows overwriting named addresses for the `--test`
 and `--dev` modes.
 alice = "0xB0B"


#### 1. Run the local Aptos network:

```bash
pnpm localnet:start
```

Local Aptos Explorer will be available on [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001/)

#### 2. Deploy the demo contract to the local network:

```bash
pnpm localnet:deploy
```

#### 3. Fund your localnet account via Aptos Wallet or the faucet:

```bash
pnpm localnet:faucet 0xYOURADDRESS
```

#### 4. Run the app:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Deployment (frontend)

Follow [this guide](https://Aptos-dapp-starter.dev/docs/frontend/deployment/firebase) to deploy the frontend app to Firebase.

### Firebase

To deploy the frontend part, do the following:

1. Install Firebase Tools

```bash
pnpm add -g firebase-tools
```

2. Create a new project on Firebase

Login to Firebase Console and create a new empty project.

3. Init your project

```bash
pnpm frontend:deploy:init
```
* You will be asked to [Login to Firebase.](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
* Then select your newly created Firebase project from the list.
* Once you're asked for a project alias, enter default.

4. Deploy to Firebase

```bash
pnpm frontend:deploy
```


## Test
